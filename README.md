# My first simple analytical project in Excel Web

This is my first project in Data Analytics, which was completed in <b>Excel Online</b>. This version is limited, so some chart formatting and slicing features were not available. For this reason, I could not select the color scheme of the slicer and remove the borders in the charts. In any case, this is my first attempt at doing something and I have to start somewhere. Many thanks for the help of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-french-data/">Chris French</a>, who explained how to use the tools in Excel.


1. So, this project presented the data that Chris shared - <b>income and expenses</b>. I combined them into one table, which can be seen on the <b>Date tab</b>.
2. Next, based on this data, I created <b>PivotCharts: Income Streams, Saving Percentage, Expenses Pie Chart, Income, Expenses. </b> 
3. Then I filled out the tables in the Dashboard tab using the functions <b>SUM, VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP</b>.
4. Added 3 charts based on the created pivot tables.
5. Added slicer using PivotTable Connections with Income_Chart, Saving_Percentage, Expenses_Pie_Chart

The first <b>Stacked Column Chart</b> shows income from different sources by month. 
The second <b>Doughnut Chart</b> shows percentage of income and expenses for the year.
The third <b>Pie Chart</b> shows percentage distribution of expenses for various needs.
Using the <b>slicer</b> (by selecting the desired month or several), you can see information on three charts for a specific month/months.

I'm glad that I finally got acquainted with Excel and tried in practice tools that I had never heard of before. A start has been made, I continue to study further.
